  description: Melee
  lore: Greedy and will do anything to get his hands on more gold. The only thing
    in the world this dwarf values is gold. Oro is a gold collector and does not
    have a preference on how he obtains his gold. Whether he stumbles upon it or
    swipes it he is always keeping an eye out for some precious gold. Oro, having
    to spend some of his gold in order to protect himself from predators, is now
    trying to make up the difference as quickly as possible by searching in places
    he has never been to before.
