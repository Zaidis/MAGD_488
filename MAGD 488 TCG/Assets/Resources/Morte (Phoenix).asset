  description: Ranged
  lore: "Morte is one of the first children born in this new realm. Their parents
    are Reagan and Cyra. They have a couple decades, about 80 years, and haven\u2019t
    experienced a rebirth yet. Morte is a chaotic child. They have the chaotic mind
    of Cyra but Reagan\u2019s patience. Which means that they have insane plans that
    never seem like they are going to work or are so complicated that no one can
    follow; and yet they still somehow work in Morte\u2019s favor. Morte likes to
    follow the delegation groups and travel to different capitals and observe the
    political atmosphere. When they go to different places and see a group of people
    who want to fight back against oppression or injustice they enter the group and
    tell them plans on how to win. When they first did this they just told the plan
    and the people executed it. They won and were able to overturn their oppressors,
    but they did not have the capability to maintain or retain what Morte taught
    them. They lost their newfound freedom and became frustrated with themselves
    and blamed Morte. Morte became jaded from that experience but Reagan explained
    to them what Morte should have done. He is following the delegation to observe
    not only how they plan but how they instruct and teach people to live justly."
