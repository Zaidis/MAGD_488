  lore: Developed in the pits of hell, Achraf assists in ruling the underworld with
    its tremendous destructive power, now ready to overtake the rest of the world.
    Being sealed away for centuries, Cerberus has been trained to be the official
    watchdog of hell. Achraf is the strongest beast in hell and has been ordered
    to leave hell to create a new hell. His only goal is to make as many beings suffer
    as possible. The sinister presence this monster emits is so powerful that it
    can make the weak-willed faint. It will not be before long that this monster
    creates hell. This beast is unique in a sense that each of its heads have a different
    type of ability. The middle one is the one that controls the body. It has a muscular
    physique and has very powerful legs. The middle head also has the ability to
    walk on and withstand deep red fire (600-800 degrees celsius). The left head
    has the ability to breath
