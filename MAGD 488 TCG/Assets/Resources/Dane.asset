  description: Pierce should be endure
  lore: "Dane is a human who comes across as mischievous and sometimes cruel. She
    likes to play pranks and mess with people. She never lets it interfere with her
    work however. Everything she turns in and works on is 100% done to its fullest
    potential. She is the head detective for the Guiding Light faction and worked
    hard to prove her position. Before she was in this realm she was an informant
    for the police while working in one of the biggest crime syndicates. She always
    dreamed of being a police officer but with rampant corruption of the police department
    she could never fully trust them. Now in this new world she always does her best
    to be the police officer she wanted to have before. Her untrusting nature might
    not make her have the most bright, white glow but she has a more touch of gray,
    dim glow around her. She still likes to prank other police officers in good jest,
    but to those she feels like is lying to others or to themselves she\u2019ll play
    pranks on them that force them to expose the truth."
