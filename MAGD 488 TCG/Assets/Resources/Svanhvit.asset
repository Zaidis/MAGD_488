  lore: Svanhvit always looked up to her older sister, Alvitr. She trained for years
    with her sister in multiple forms of combat. When her and their friend, Olrun,
    fell into this strange realm Svanhvit first went to look for her sister. When
    Alvitr was trying to wrangle everyone together it was Svanhvit who was acting
    as a mediator when tensions were getting too high and hostility was brewing.
    She stood next to her sister and welcomed the people that looked up to Alvitr.
    Svanhvit has a kind face with warm eyes. She seems to always be smiling, even
    passively just a small smile. When other factions are having trouble with each
    other or within their own faction people go to her to act as a mediator. She
    is someone that people always feel like will listen to them and that she is willing
    to do what she can to help others find peace.
