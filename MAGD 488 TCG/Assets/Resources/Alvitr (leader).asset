  lore: Alvtir spent many years training alongside her sister, Svanhvit, and their
    dear friend Olrun. One day they were bathing in a spring and were found by three
    brothers, and were married to them. They spent 8 years together and in their
    ninth year the three Valkyries left to fulfill their destiny. The three of them
    journeyed across the plains of their home realm until they were brought to the
    Mythos realm. Surrounded by strange creatures they have never heard of before
    and some they have never seen before. As the eldest of her trio, Alvitr saw it
    fit to try and bring order to this chaotic realm they were thrust into. The three
    of them gather like-minded individuals to try and bring order. There were creatures
    that saw them as oppressors in their new realm, new life, and went against them;
    and those that saw their efforts for its good and followed Alvtir. Alvitr led
    her group of people and left towards the mountains. They came across a flat plain
    surrounded by the mountains, waterfalls, and terraces with the sun shining on
    it. Not wanting to disrupt the balance of nature she ordered that all buildings
    and technology work with the nature surrounding them. She founded the government
    and its cities. She still seeks to help bring order and balance to this realm.
    When her people saw her they saw a glow of pure light of justice and righteousness
    that made them feel safe, but also could not look at her for too long. Though
    she seems unapproachable everyone knows how kind she is, blunt and cutting at
    times, but gentle as well.
