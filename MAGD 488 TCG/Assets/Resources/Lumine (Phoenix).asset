  description: Melee Pierce
  lore: Lumine is a 900 year old Phoenix. They are on their 3rd life and on their
    current longest. Lumine has experienced many joys in their lives that they are
    continuously grateful for. They love to be around children and in their home
    realm they, and still in this realm, go to orphanages and hospitals and sing
    songs for them. They have been present for multiple deaths and done their best
    to make the passing as peaceful and loving as possible. During the times of war
    their songs rang just as much as the battle sounds raged. For a couple decades
    Lumine was unable to sing and their heart broke. They entered an era of seclusion
    and reflected on their past. While it would have been easy to be angry and only
    remember the hatred towards those that cause wars, become joyful at tragedy,
    and harm the innocence, and for a time they did, Lumine chose to remember the
    eyes of those that stared at them like their songs was a soothing balm against
    the pain. The grips of those that clung to them as their bodies shook like Lumine
    was the only stable thing around them. The warmth of the children that went to
    sleep while smiling, listening to their song.
