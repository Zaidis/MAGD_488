  description: 
  lore: "Constance will do anything to uphold her honor and be true to her word.
    In her past life she was the right hand person to a duke, and is still trying
    to uphold her honor to him and return. She travels around trying to figure out
    the secrets of this realm and how they all got there. She currently leads a small
    group of people who are searching for the same thing. With each passing year
    that they fail to find the answer her resolve is shaken. She is desperately searching
    for an answer and does not know what she will do if it comes to be that there
    is no way back. In her moments of doubt she sits and meditates with the weapon
    that was given to her by the duke when she swore to him. She continues to reinforce
    the dukedom\u2019s official armor and refuses to get rid of the weapon. She will
    always be loyal to the Duke and no matter what comes her way she will be his
    right hand person once again."
