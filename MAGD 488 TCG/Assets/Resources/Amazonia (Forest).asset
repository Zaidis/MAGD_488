  lore: Nothing too special about Amazonia except that she is a hard working gnome
    that takes care of a family of four. She gathers food, hunts, cooks, cleans,
    and sells jewelry to make money. Amazonia is a very old gnome and she has been
    to every forest this world has to offer. She now resides in her favorite forest
    where she thinks she can be the most profitable and beneficial for her family.
