  description: 'Special Effect Arrows (fire/burn, etc) (4-5 mana cost)

    mana cost) (send individual animal hawk = 3 mana boar = 4) (or set one animal)'
  lore: "Kaylon was a mercenary in his ordinary realm and continued to do so when
    he was thrust into the Mythos Realm. However, unlike ordinary mercenaries that
    take whatever job is the most paying, Kaylon chooses his job by his morals. If
    the job is to safeguard a horrible person he will instead choose to fight that
    person. If the job is to find a runaway person and finds out that they were being
    abused he\u2019ll help them escape and hunt down the abuser. If the job is from
    an innocent trying to get justice that they themselves cannot get he will do
    it for free or at least a discounted price. His sense of justice and righteousness
    has given him a light aura that one can barely see, but is there nonetheless.
    Kaylon is someone who loves to tame animals and creatures. He is always grateful
    that his trusted companion and steed, Layn, was able to come into this realm
    with him. He has other animals that come and go with him and animals seem to
    be naturally drawn to him. He has a kind and guarded expression that makes people
    underestimate him. However in the heat of battle his face becomes closed off
    and he becomes a ruthless machine."
