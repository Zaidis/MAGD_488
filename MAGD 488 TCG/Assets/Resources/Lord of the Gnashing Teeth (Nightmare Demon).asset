  description: 'Ranged

    Self-Buff: Gain Thorns'
  lore: 'Though this demon has no true form, it acts like an advisor to Erland. Assisting
    in battle plans and taking what can be guessed as pleasure when it unleashes
    itself upon targets of strategic import so the rabble can do what they do best,
    cause chaos and take more for feeding and rituals. '
