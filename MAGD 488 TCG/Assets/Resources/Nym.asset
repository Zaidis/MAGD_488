  description: 'Ranged

    4 Mana: All friendly ranged creatures +1/ +1'
  lore: Nym is an elf who seems to be able to get away with anything. Though they
    could, they never intentionally do something to harm another. They just have
    good intentions that tend to translate into inconveniences and trouble for others.
    Though their sincerity shines through so no one can be mad at them for too long.
    They are the leader of a monster hunting group, and each member of that squad
    would sacrifice themselves for them in an instant. Nym themselves do not know
    about this, nor would they ever ask that of them. They would sooner sacrifice
    themselves than ask it of them. Nym can charm anyone they talk to within minutes
    of meeting them. Nym has a habit of talking too much about their own business
    and other people's business. Everyone that knows of Nym knows not to gossip with
    them or tell them secrets because Nym will accidentally blab it to the next person
    they talk to. One of Nym's favorite places to be in is the kitchen. They seem
    to have a bottomless stomach and is an excellent cook. If there ever comes a
    time when Nym could retire they would open a restaurant of their very own.
