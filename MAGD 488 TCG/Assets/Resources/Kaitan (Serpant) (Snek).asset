  description: 
  lore: "Known as the \u201CSea Snake\u201D, Kaitan ruled a few territories and counting
    in the ocean biome. This came to a halt when Hafgufa came to power. Having surrendered
    his territories, Kaitan is now under the protection of Hafgufa but is still a
    very formidable beast. "
