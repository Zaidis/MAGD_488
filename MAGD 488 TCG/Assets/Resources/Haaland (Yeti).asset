  description: Melee Pierce
  lore: The snow biomes strongest beast has been terrorizing the villiages all over
    the land for centuries in search for a worthy opponent. Demonstrating tremendous
    strength through his pilages, Haaland is not to be taken lightly. He is a tall
    muscular humanoid creature covered in white fur which allows him to endure the
    cold temperatures during his pilages. A somewhat lazy monster, Haaland relies
    on the villagers across the biome in order to survive. Instead of hunting himself,
    he prefers to steal from the villagers and cleans them out of their supplies.
    After he is satisfied he murders the villagers so they do not have to suffer
    in the freezing climate. Haaland firmly believes in survival of the fittest.
    He towers over most creatures with long legs and tree trunk calves. His arms
    are the size of cannons and are just as powerful. He is a monster that relies
    on his survival instincts and his brute strength to survive. Haaland might not
    be the most terrifying monster out there as he looks more human than most, but
    he is the smartest. Haaland has been able to adapt to his surroundings and take
    advantage of things in his surroundings, such as using a tree branch as a weapon
    or using a weapon a villager he saw use.
