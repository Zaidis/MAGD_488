  description: 
  lore: "Laiken is a calm and quiet fairy. She doesn\u2019t really do much and tends
    to just swim with the currents of life. She likes to play the harp and flute
    while floating down a stream. When the topic of representative for the fairies
    she immediately turned down the position saying that it was too much work. She
    has gotten into trouble with Elin before about her carefree nature and tends
    to avoid him. She doesn\u2019t know much about Aodhan and avoids him because
    he is too loud. "
