  lore: Every 4 years the centaurs participate in a savage battle royal to find the
    next Don (leader). Leandro was not a favorite by any means to win this competition.
    This was his first year eligible to participate and Leandro exceeded the expectations
    that were set for him. Continuing to surpass his limitations he even defeated
    the previous Don who has won the last 7 of these events. Leandro defied all odds
    to acquire the title of the Don and now his legacy begins. What separates Leandro
    from the rest of the bunch is that he is a pegasus centaur. His majestical wings
    extend to 14ft long and can allow him to fly at speeds over 100mph. Leandro is
    the first pegasus centaur born in the last 150 years and has been training since
    his birth to fulfill his dream to become the Don of the Centaurs.
