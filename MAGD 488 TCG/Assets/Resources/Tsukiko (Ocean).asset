  lore: "Tsukiko is an ocean kitsune with 6 tails. Tsukiko got her sixth tail after
    coming to this realm and beating a sea monster and taking control over its territory.
    She is not someone who seeks out other people\u2019s presence, but she also does
    not tell people to leave when they come to her. She is prideful in her own right
    and seeks out a place of her own. When she found an ocean of her liking she took
    it away from the one that was currently controlling it. She did not hesitate
    in attacking the creature and fought it for many hours before defeating it. Recently
    a young kit, Masanori, approached her for stories and guidance. She knew that
    he was near her for some time but let him come to her before speaking to him.
    She likes to tell stories about herself and her conquests."
