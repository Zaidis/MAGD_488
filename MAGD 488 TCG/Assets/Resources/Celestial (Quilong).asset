  description: N/A. CAN'T GO IN DECK!!!
  lore: "Trying to make the world its own, this beasts' true instincts have taken
    over and leveled every biome in this world. Celestial, the mightiest of beasts,
    has been dormant for hundreds of years since its last assault. During Celestial\u2019s
    slumber, the survivors have been restoring their lands and homes as best as they
    can. Now, the strongest beast this world has seen has finally been summoned to
    reclaim its title from these emerging beasts and will attempt to lead this world
    to a new dawn. This new dawn, Celestial envisions, is a world of solely dragons.
    A world  where they are the only species alive. Celestial was summoned by three
    younger dragons who see Celestial as their master. They believe in Celestial\u2019s
    dream and want to see it through.  What seemed impossible, is much more of reality
    now that a true beast has reemerged. What stands out about this beast is it's
    slick but tough scales. This beast knows how to take a hit. Celestial is known
    for its defensive capabilities, its scales are nearly impossible to penetrate.
    Defense is not it's only specialty. Celestial breathes white fire (1500 degrees
    celsius) but it is so powerful it appears more of a laser-like beam. Not having
    wings, it resorts to using the steam clouds it produces from its nose as footing
    for him to move in the air. "
