  lore: 'Kiyoshi is a thunder kitsune with 4 tails. Kiyoshi is trying to get his
    5th tail after spending many years in his previous realm in stagnation. He was
    becoming frustrated with himself and is now exploring the realm trying to use
    this new experience as a new tactic to get one. When he comes across Kimi she
    often teases him for his progress and he snaps at her. It has become his mission
    to at least land a hit on Kimi. '
