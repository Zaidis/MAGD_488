  description: 
  lore: Atticus, a slightly older Centaur, has an exceptional talent for battle but
    chooses not to participate in such activity. Atticus believes all battles can
    be dueled with words. He has come to this conclusion after his rigorous battles
    in the past. However despite this revelation, he will have to participate in
    this war due to being drafted into the proud centaur army. Atticus has long flowing
    white hair with a chic white coat. His tail hair is also very long and thick.
    His skin is smooth with no scratches on it.
