  lore: "Keaira is a materialistic and sticky finger fairy. She loves to surround
    herself with jewels and shiny objects. She\u2019ll use her darkness to shroud
    her movements as she finds something shiny. It\u2019s almost compulsory at this
    point for her to take something that draws her in. She becomes giddy like a child
    when she is playing with her jewels and collected items. It becomes hard to part
    with her objects when she has them even if she needs to trade them or sell them;
    or to add magic to any of her jewels for her protection."
