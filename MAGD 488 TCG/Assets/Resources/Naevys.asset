  description: Melee Thorns Pierce
  lore: "Naevys is a contender for the next in line to be leader of Valysus, if Alvtir
    ever decides to retire. Naevys, to others, is a himbo. He works out for fun and
    is large and very very strong. Someone once saw him go to an orphanage and give
    a piggy-back ride to all 13 kids at the same time and do laps around the orphanage.
    He is incredibly adorable and is nice to everyone that he meets. He always gives
    everyone the benefit of the doubt, and always seems to have the right words that
    reach people\u2019s hearts. Though he might not look like, or act like it, he
    is actually very insightful. Everyone thinks he\u2019s just a bear with a heart
    of gold, but actually has a keen eye for body language and detail and is very
    methodical in his research and learning. Naevys is the one that can enter a room
    on the verge of war and walk away leaving peace and merry hand-shaking behind
    him. While it, at first, comes at a surprise to people that Naevys is the most
    likely to inherit the leadership from Alvtir, when they think about it it makes
    perfect sense. Unlike Alvtir who\u2019s aura of justice can seem blinding and
    unapproachable, his, an equally bright aura, is like being bathed in sunlight
    on a perfect day."
