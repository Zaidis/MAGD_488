  description: Copy Health and Attack of target creature
  lore: "Faelyn is, at heart, a performer. Always acting with a flourish and flamboyance.
    They can\u2019t help but try to have a grand speech and performance for every
    interaction. They were a well-known actor before coming to this realm; and an
    equally well-known thief. Though no one made the connection between the two of
    them. Faelyn enjoyed having the secret of being a thief and made it into another
    role of theirs. With all of their roles and the actor's urge to become their
    character they have found themselves occasionally wondering who they really are.
    They always try to be the perfect character. The perfect friend, the perfect
    employee, the perfect mentor that they always change their personality to fit
    what that perfection means to who they are interacting with. More than once they
    have been caught staring into the mirror, like they are searching for something
    that they want to be there but can\u2019t find it. Those that find them like
    that don\u2019t know what to do, but to tell them it\u2019s time for the show
    to start. They take a second and with a flourish of their hand wave them off
    and tell them to lead the way."
