  description: Ranged
  lore: This Gnome loves to go around and impersonate other gnomes. Winston does
    whatever he can to get underneath people's skin. He is energetic, flamboyant,
    and has no boundaries. Size does not matter to Winston, you can be three times
    his size or half his size he will find a way to inconvenience you. The most annoying
    gnome to walk this world, Winston will toy with anyone at his leisure.
