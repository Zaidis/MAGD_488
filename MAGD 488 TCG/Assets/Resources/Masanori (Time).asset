  description: Melee
  lore: Masanori is a time kitsune with 2 tails. Masanori has recently gotten his
    second tail and is quite proud of that fact. He got it when he came into this
    realm. When he got to this realm he met with the other kitsune, but was scared
    of Kimi and intimidated by Kiyoshi. Tsukiko was the most approachable but it
    still took him a long time to try and approach her for advice and guidance. He
    has a youthful need to impress and grow and a child's innocence.
