  description: 
  lore: Benedict chooses not to participate in the barbaric ways of the rest of the
    centaurs. Instead he Always in search of the next adventure. He wants to explore
    the whole world and still has so much of it to see. Benedict does most of his
    traveling during the night. His slick black coat and long black hair blends in
    with the darkness of the night making him exceedingly stealthy. He makes a living
    off of stealing from and scamming random civilians.
