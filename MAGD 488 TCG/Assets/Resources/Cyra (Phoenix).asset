  description: Ranged Pierce
  lore: "Cyra is a phoenix who has lived for about 1300 years. They are currently
    on their 12th life, being reborn 11 times, and has been in this cycle for about
    80 years. Their longest life was about 200 years and the shortest 1 month. They
    are rambunctious and daring, to a frightening degree. If someone asks \u201CWhat
    would happen if you\u2026\u201D or \u201CDo you think you could survive\u2026\u201D
    Cyra is the first to volunteer to do it. Without prompting sometimes and with
    absolutely no warning. Their disregard for their own safety has been a cause
    of concern for those closest to them, and the arguments that ensue have lost
    some. What gave them their lack of sense of safety and care for one\u2019s life
    was an incident that happened in their fourth life. Cyra came from a realm where
    magical creatures were taken and experimented on. They did their best to protect
    the other creatures before their capture, but sacrificed themselves to protect
    a group of magical creatures. They were captured and experimented on multiple
    times and were forced to die in gruesome manners multiple times. Even in captivity
    they would try and protect those that they can. It still haunts them the lives
    they couldn\u2019t save and their own screams"
