  description: Ranged Pierce
  lore: "Raegan is a phoenix that has lived for about 1700 years. Their longest life
    was about 800 years, his shortest about 90 years, and has been reborn about 4
    times. Raegan is the Chief of Police. They are currently on their 5th life and
    have been alive for about 300 years now. Morte is their child and their partner
    for Morte was Cyra. Phoenix\u2019s do not have life partners, since they can
    live multiple lives, but Cyra and Raegan remain good friends. Phoenixes also
    live in communal nesting to help raise the children. Raegan is like everyone\u2019s
    parent. They are always looking out for everyone under them. The officers and
    detectives under them look up to Raegan and appreciate their wisdom and experience.
    The puns are something they can do without but Raegan has no plans to stop. They
    are patient and wise. Before coming to this realm Raegan lived peacefully in
    the mountains with their communal nest. However, after an attack on their nest
    leaving Raegan as the only survivor they became bitter and filled with rage.
    After tracking down who attacked them and exacting their revenge they found themselves
    not filled with satisfaction nor closure. Their family was still gone and nothing
    could bring them back. They wandered for a bit, traveling from nest to nest,
    for years. Seeing all the young chicks and playing with them as they traveled
    helped bring Raegan back. When Raegan and the other phoenixes were brought to
    this realm they saw Lumine, a young chick that hasn\u2019t even had their first
    rebirth, they immediately went into parent mode to protect them. Raegan became
    the Chief of Police at the Guiding Light faction due to their personality and
    their experience in life and in tracking down clues and knowing true justice."
