  description: Ranged Pierce
  lore: "Gova is a runner (she\u2019s a runner, she's a trackstar). She is someone
    who gets nervous when around people. She tends to stick behind people and be
    a wallflower. Sometimes she gets stuck inside her own head, so she heads down
    to the beaches and runs alongside the coast line to clear her head. Unlike the
    others, Gova came to this realm alone. Before she was in the realm she was in
    the rear of her vanguard. She is always someone to come in as support, both in
    battle and personal. Due to her quiet nature people find themselves talking to
    her just to vent and not have someone offer unwanted advice or judgment. Just
    quiet encouragement. Also because of this, she loves gossip. She gets excited
    to hear gossip from other people who tell her and just what she can hear when
    others think no one else is listening."
