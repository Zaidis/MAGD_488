  lore: Kimi is a wind kitsune with 9 tails. Kimi is an old kitsune and has gotten
    her 9 tails before coming to this realm. Kimi is a proud kitsune with an arrogant
    attitude. When Masanori went to Tsukiko for advice and guidance rather than her,
    her pride got wounded. She became more bristly towards Masanori and Tsukiko.
    She likes to go and find Kiyoshi and tease him, but also finds herself becoming
    proud when she sees him coming closer and closer to getting his new tail.
