  lore: "Ashryn is a bookworm. They spend most of their time with their nose in a
    book. Her parents were both knights that served Alvtir proudly until their untimely
    deaths after being sent to deal with a monster raid in a village. The monster
    was never defeated and the village was destroyed. The loss of her parents, and
    the extremeness of their death, has made Ashryn retreat into her books. When
    she was young she wanted to join the knight ranks with her parents, but now greatly
    avoids the knights. Since most of her friends were children of her parent\u2019s
    knight comrades, and those children followed the footsteps of their parents,
    she lost many of her friends. She was not alone however. She has friends that
    share her love of books and that do their best to try and get her head out of
    the clouds. Recently, a monster raid attacked a village she was visiting, for
    a book signing, and something awakened within Ashryn. Whether it was something
    good or not is up for debate. Ashryn used to carry her parent\u2019s ideal of
    justice and shared their glow, but after their deaths her glow dimmed. When the
    monster tore down the bookstore and she came face to face with a monster for
    the first time in years a sense of injustice raged within her. The injustice
    that no one got the monster that killed her parents, the injustice of this peaceful
    village getting attacked for no reason. A shadow came over and she screamed as
    she charged at the monster and defeated it. In a blind rage she held her own
    until the knights came and took the rest of the raid. She was hailed a hero by
    the village for protecting them, but she only thought of darkness that overtook
    her. She is investing her time in investigating what it was and what it means.
    Afraid of what it could mean, and so also looking for the justice her parents
    believed in, died for."
