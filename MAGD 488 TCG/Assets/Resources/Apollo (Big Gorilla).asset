  description: 
  lore: 'Apollo is a giant ape who lives in the jungle biome. He is a monster only
    to the creatures who he believes deserves it. He is the least monstrous of the
    monsters but that does not mean he lacks strength. Apollo destroys based on how
    one lives. If he thinks they are useless to him he destroys everything that is
    important to them. '
