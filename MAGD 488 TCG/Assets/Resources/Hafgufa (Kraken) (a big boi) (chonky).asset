  description: '4 Mana: Sacrifice a friendly creature, create a 3/3/1 Token in hand'
  lore: "Ruler of the Ocean Biome, Hafgufa has punished everything that has stood
    in his path. Dismantling the villages and other monsters in this biome, Hafgua
    quickly became the most feared creature in the ocean. However, the path taken
    by him has not been without cost. To Hafgufa, in order to achieve true power,
    one must shed their weaknesses. To obtain his goal of taking over the ocean biome,
    he had to eliminate all that was dear to him. Realizing his talents at a young
    age, Hafgufa has had the time to plot and the next phase is soon to begin\u2026
    Hafgufa uses the water to his advantage. He drags his opponents using his tentacles
    to strangle and drown them until their will to live is no more. Legend says that
    his tentacles are so strong and versatile that they can support his weight which
    allows him to walk on land. Hafgufa has left lasting impressions on the few survivors
    who have lived to tell his monstrous tale. "
