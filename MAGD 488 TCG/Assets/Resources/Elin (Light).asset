  description: Ranged
  lore: Elin is a temperamental and passionate fairy. He has had trouble with his
    temper since he was a young child and has done his best to control it. He has
    made great strides throughout his life, but in the last debate for who should
    lead the fairies he was becoming frustrated with the stagnation of who should
    lead and blew up at his opponent, Aodhan. This led to the declaration that Aodhan
    would represent the fairies. While he understands the reasoning behind it it
    still leaves a bitter taste in his mouth. While remaining to be a sort of leader
    or go to for people in official matters he tends to stay quiet at meetings to
    avoid blowing up.
