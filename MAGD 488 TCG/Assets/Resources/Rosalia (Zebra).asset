  lore: Rosalia is a strong centaur that has consistently competed at the battle
    royals throughout the years. She has not been the luckiest however. Her best
    finish was 2nd in what was the previous Dons final victory. Rosalia has a rough
    coat of black and white fur. She has scars all over his body from the numerous
    battles she has partaken in. Rosalia fights for the thrill, nothing more.
