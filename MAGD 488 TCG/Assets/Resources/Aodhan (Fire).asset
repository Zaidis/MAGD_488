  description: Ranged
  lore: 'Aodhan is a boisterous and loud fairy. He always seems to be the life of
    a party. Always bringing good times and leaving happy memories with those that
    interact with him. He is always preaching about not just living a long life,
    but a good life. A good life filled with crazy memories and good friends. Aodhan
    might seem like a pushover or gullible fairy but is actually very tactful. He
    seems to be able to say a lot without saying anything; and can direct a conversation
    any way he wishes. He just tends to wish to talk about fun things. He became
    the leader of the fairies after much discussion and debate amongst them. He was
    neck and neck with Elin but it ultimately went to him when Elin lost his composure
    at the last debate. '
