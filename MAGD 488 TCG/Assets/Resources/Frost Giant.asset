  description: Melee Cleave
  lore: "While \u2018giant\u2019 isn\u2019t apt to physically describe the jotunn,
    these creatures are truly tricky. Using illusions and magic to assault their
    enemies, especially those from Asgard. Though at first they were caught off guard
    from the shift, they have found themselves the cream of the crop due to their
    former brawling with actual gods. "
