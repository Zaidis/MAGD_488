  lore: 'As the tomb of his family was brought into this strange and dangerous world,
    Erland was content keeping him and his tomb guarded from interlopers. However
    as more beings approached his tomb, he thought that now being detached from his
    homeland, why not use this opportunity to conquer once again. '
