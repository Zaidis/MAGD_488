  description: 
  lore: "Rowan was a wanted criminal before coming into this new realm. He came from
    a realm that didn\u2019t have any fantastical creatures like mermaids or fairies,
    so when he came here and the awesome power of other creatures he realized how
    small he could be. When he was settling down he saw a young child that was left
    alone, lost and confused. He looked at the child and saw himself when he was
    young, so he decided to be the adult that he needed when he was young and took
    the child, Kerian, in. He took the child and went to a village and settled down
    there. The village knows him as a kind and caring father who was always helpful.
    Whenever someone was harassing or trying to start any trouble he was the one
    that would take care of it. Sometimes he seemed to slip into his previous life\u2019s
    mentality but would quickly come out of it and apologizes for it. The specifics
    of his past, the village doesn\u2019t know, though they can guess,  but they
    don\u2019t care. He might not have a pure white glow or even more than a dim,
    but he protects them and is kind and fair to them. He became the representative
    of the village and goes to the Valysus capital on the village's behalf."
