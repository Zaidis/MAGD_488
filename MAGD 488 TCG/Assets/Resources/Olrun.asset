  description: Ranged
  lore: Olrun became friends with Alvitr and Svanhvit when they were all on the same
    battlefield fighting for Freya, Norse Goddess. Olrun was never one to make a
    big scene or become the center of attention. She mostly stayed within her lane
    and appeared when she was told to do and do what needed to be done. She likes
    to spend her time hiking, mountain climbing, and fishing. She is a very outdoorsy
    person. Because of this she has many friends within the nymph, fairy, and other
    nature communities. Her closest friends remain to be Alvitr and Svanhvit but
    she is still close with Laiken, a water fairy that stays in the waters near her
    home.
